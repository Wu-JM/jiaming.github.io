I am currently a PhD student at LPS Orsay (Laboratory of Solid-State Physics, a joint research unit of Université Paris-Saclay and CNRS) under the supervision of Prof. Marcelo Rozenberg and Dr. Olivier Schneegans. My thesis is focusing on ring attractors in recurrent spiking neural networks. I am interested in neural networks, computer hardwares, physics and so on.
